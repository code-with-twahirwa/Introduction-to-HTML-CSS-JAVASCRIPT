        <h3>Brief Biography</h3>
        <Text>
            He studied law at the University of Hare and University of Witwatersrand before practicing law in Johannesburg. He spent most of his youthful and middle-age years passionately fighting against colonialism and the apartheid system in South Africa. In 1962, he was unjustly sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government. After serving his sentence for 27 years, he was freed in 1990 after the fall of the apartheid government in his country. On May 1994, he elected the first African native president of South Africa, an event was greatly celebrated on the entire African continent. He died in 2013 at the age of 95.
